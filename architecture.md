# Scalable Video Tutoring Platform Architecture

## Overview

The tutoring platform will be built using a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. We'll use Azure services for hosting and Azure Communication Services (ACS) for video functionality.

## Architecture Components

1. **Frontend**:
   - React.js single-page application (SPA)
   - Hosted on Azure Static Web Apps

2. **Backend**:
   - FastAPI microservices
   - Containerized and deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

3. **Database**:
   - Azure Cosmos DB (MongoDB API) for user data and session metadata

4. **Authentication**:
   - Azure Active Directory B2C for user authentication and management

5. **Video Services**:
   - Azure Communication Services for video calls and chat

6. **API Gateway**:
   - Azure API Management for routing and rate limiting

7. **Caching**:
   - Azure Redis Cache for session data and token caching

8. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Azure Monitor and Application Insights

9. **Content Delivery**:
   - Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static assets

## Data Flow

1. Users access the React.js frontend hosted on Azure Static Web Apps.
2. Authentication requests are handled by Azure AD B2C.
3. API requests are routed through Azure API Management to the appropriate FastAPI microservice.
4. Video call requests are processed by the ACS integration microservice.
5. User data and session metadata are stored in Azure Cosmos DB.
6. Redis Cache is used for quick access to session data and tokens.
7. Monitoring and logging data are collected by Azure Monitor and Application Insights.

## Scalability

- AKS allows for easy scaling of backend microservices.
- Azure Cosmos DB provides global distribution and automatic scaling.
- Azure CDN ensures fast content delivery worldwide.
- Azure Communication Services scales automatically to handle concurrent video calls.

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building a scalable, secure, and performant tutoring platform with video capabilities.
